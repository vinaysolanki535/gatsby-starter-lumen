## functionality of this clone

+ it has google authentaction which is provided by google firebase auth
+ a user can compose new emals and sen it to another user all fields are required to fill because of react form hook .
+ all UI related part is done by material UI .
+ it also uses react router for prevent refresh pages


redux is more then capable for scalling any web app it has nice slicing feature we can create number of slice like user , email for store defferent kind of data and pull it anywhere in app.
